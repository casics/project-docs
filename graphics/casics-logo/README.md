CASICS logo notes
=================

To create the CASICS logo, I looked at many other logos and icons (for example on [iconshock.com](https://iconshock.com)), and then created something from scratch.  At first I used OmniGraffle to create the artwork, thinking it would save me time (because the design is quite simple and uses simple shapes). After getting it done and settling on the colors and getting other details finished, I _then_ discovered the SVG output from OmniGraffle had a graphic glitch---some lines didn't overlap correctly. Also, I couldn't figure out how to make a cut-out using objects in OO, so I couldn't create a logo where the white areas were transparent.

I finally imported the OmniGraffle SVG into Adobe Illustrator CS6 and then fixed it up to produce the final version.

The file [casics-logo-variants.graffle](casics-logo-variants.graffle) contains the initial logo work done in OO, including different colors.  For the final logo, I settled on a kind of blue/green color that I jokingly call "steel teal".
