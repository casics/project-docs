The file "github-project-ids-2015.txt" is a list of the GitHub project identifiers (for public GitHub projects) that we had in our database at the end of 2015, after using our home-grown cataloguer to acquire data via the GitHub API.  The total number of identifiers is 24,544,435.  This list of identifiers was the basis of selecting a random sample of projects used for further analysis.  We have saved the list of raw identifiers as a matter of proper data preservation.
