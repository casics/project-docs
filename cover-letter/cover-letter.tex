Dear Editors of JSS,

We are submitting the attached manuscript for your kind review for publication in the Journal of Systems and Software.  The manuscript, \emph{``Software search is not a science, even among scientists: A survey of how scientists and engineers find software}'', describes the results of a survey we conducted in an effort to better understand how users in science and engineering look for software.

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and has not been submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere.  An early version has previously been put in arXiv (\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02265}), but the manuscript before you is \emph{substantially} rewritten from that prior version.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
