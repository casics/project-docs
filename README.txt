This uses a simple custom latex style (unimaginatively named
“casicswhitepaper”), and in this style, there is a macro for making notes to
ourselves in the margins:

  \note{some text}

The note will be put in the output next to the paragraph in which the \note{}
is embedded.

Testing notification. Ignore this.
