Arxiv refuses to let you upload PDFs that have been generated by latex; they insist they want the latex source code and they want to generate it on their end.  This is a pain; for one thing, they don't use bibtex and some Googling around reveals that bibtex users have trouble with generating .bbl files that work with arxiv's system.  For another thing, we have a custom format that uses a lot of other latex packages and I don't feel like debugging version skew and who-knows-what-other problems.  And frankly, what kind of policy is it that doesn't let you generate PDFs if you know what you're doing?  I find this insulting.

So I found a solution: http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/186206/8318

The Makefile generates a final PDF to upload.
