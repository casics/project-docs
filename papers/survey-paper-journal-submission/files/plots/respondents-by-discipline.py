# About the data: in the category of "other", we had the following responses:
#
# - One person answered thus: Computing & Math Sci. (CMS), "astrophysics",
#   "IT".  I added 1 to the count of physical sciences (the rationale being
#   that astrophysics is a physical science) but didn't change the count of
#   CMS because IT can be considered part of CMS at our level of granularity.
#
# - One person answered CMS, and "Pri. A&A" and "Cosmology".  I added 1 more
#   to physical sciences for the A&A and cosmology (because they did not also
#   select Physical Sciences, so this is a case where the count needs to be
#   adjusted).
#
# - One person answered "Data science" but not also CMS, so I added 1 to CMS.
#
# - Two people answered "Astronomy" for "other" as well as answering
#   "physical sciences".  We would lump astronomy under physical sciences, so
#   it does not change the count for physical sciences.
#
# - One person answered "Aerospace Engineering (Robotics)".  I don't know
#   where to put that one, so left it as a real "Other".
